# Checker API hack day
Hack Day #2. Building an app using Holberton school API
## The project
By team of ~8, you are free to build what you want, it just needs to be related to Holberton and the Checker. You are starting now until tomorrow night.

You can build a web app, a desktop app, a game, a webhook, a SDK, a Git hook, etc. the only limit is your creativity (and our API limits!) You can also integrate other API like Github or Twitter for example.

Example of projects:

* Check your code when you push it to Github
* Reward user when all checks are passing for the first time with a message in Slack
* Post in Twitter the user usage of the Checker (statistic of checks passed)
etc.
